**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Status:** Proposed
**Author:** AI Assistant (Gemini)
**Project Owner:** [To Be Determined]

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge but are inherently limited by the cutoff date of their training data. This means they may not be aware of the latest developments, features, or documentation updates for rapidly evolving technologies. The LLM Context Augmentation Tool aims to bridge this gap by enabling users to generate up-to-date markdown summaries from specified technology documentation or relevant web sources. This generated context can then be supplied to LLMs to enhance their accuracy and relevance with current information.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### 2.1. Primary Goal
To empower users to provide LLMs with the most current and relevant information about any given technology by generating a concise, structured markdown document from its latest official documentation or other specified web sources.

### 2.2. Key Objectives
* **O1: User Accessibility:** Develop an intuitive and user-friendly web interface for inputting a technology search prompt or specific documentation URLs.
* **O2: Efficient Information Retrieval:** Implement a robust backend system capable of intelligently identifying, crawling, and fetching content from relevant documentation URLs.
* **O3: Accurate Content Processing:** Accurately extract the core informational content from fetched web pages, stripping away non-essential elements (e.g., navigation, advertisements, sidebars).
* **O4: High-Quality Markdown Generation:** Convert the processed content into clean, well-structured, and readable markdown format.
* **O5: Seamless Output Delivery:** Allow users to easily view, copy, or download the generated markdown file.
* **O6: System Reliability & Scalability:** Build a dependable and scalable solution using modern web technologies (React, TypeScript, Convex) capable of handling a reasonable load.

## 3. Target Audience

* **TA1: LLM Developers & Prompt Engineers:** Individuals and teams integrating LLMs into applications who need to ensure models have access to the latest information for tasks like code generation, Q&A, content creation, and technical support.
* **TA2: Software Engineers & DevOps Practitioners:** Professionals seeking consolidated information on new library versions, API changes, framework updates, or platform release notes.
* **TA3: Technical Writers & Researchers:** Individuals who need to quickly gather, summarize, and reference recent updates for various technologies.
* **TA4: Students & Learners:** Individuals studying new technologies who want to get the most up-to-date overview from official sources.

## 4. User Stories

* **US1:** As a developer using an LLM for coding assistance, I want to input "React 19 new hooks" and receive a markdown document detailing these hooks from the official React documentation, so I can provide this context to my LLM for accurate code generation.
* **US2:** As a technical writer, I want to specify the URL for the "Python 3.13 release notes" and get a markdown summary of the key changes, so I can quickly incorporate it into my update bulletins.
* **US3:** As an LLM prompt engineer, I want to search for "Kubernetes 1.30 API deprecations" and receive a markdown file outlining these, so I can craft more effective and informed prompts.
* **US4:** As a user, I want to see a clear indication of the processing status (e.g., "fetching," "parsing," "converting," "complete," "error") after submitting my request.
* **US5:** As a user, I want to be able to easily copy the entire generated markdown to my clipboard or download it as a `.md` file.
* **US6:** As a user, I want the tool to prioritize official documentation sources when I provide a general technology name.
* **US7:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to get the latest changelog for "Terraform AWS provider v5.x" in markdown to quickly understand recent updates.

## 5. Proposed Solution Overview

The LLM Context Augmentation Tool will be a web application comprising:
* **Frontend (React + TypeScript):** A user interface allowing users to submit a search query (technology name, specific feature) or a direct URL to documentation. It will display the status of the request and the final markdown output.
* **Backend (Convex):** A serverless backend responsible for:
    1.  **URL Discovery (if a search query is provided):** Using search engine APIs or predefined rules to find the most relevant official documentation page(s).
    2.  **Web Crawling:** Fetching the HTML content from the identified URL(s).
    3.  **Content Extraction:** Parsing the HTML to isolate the main informational content, removing boilerplate (headers, footers, navigation, ads).
    4.  **Markdown Conversion:** Transforming the cleaned HTML into well-structured markdown.
    5.  **Data Management:** Storing request status and potentially caching results.

## 6. Key Features & Functionality (V1.0 - MVP)

### 6.1. User Input & Request Management
* **F1.1:** Single input field for users to enter either:
    * A technology name/feature query (e.g., "Django 5.1 release notes").
    * A specific URL to a documentation page.
* **F1.2:** "Generate Markdown" button to submit the request.
* **F1.3:** Real-time display of request status (e.g., "Pending," "Searching for sources...", "Fetching content...", "Parsing HTML...", "Converting to Markdown...", "Completed," "Failed").
* **F1.4:** Clear error messages displayed to the user if a step fails (e.g., "URL not found," "Content extraction error").

### 6.2. Documentation Discovery & Fetching
* **F2.1:** If a URL is provided, directly fetch content from that URL.
* **F2.2:** If a search query is provided:
    * (MVP Simplification) Basic heuristic: attempt `https://[query].dev`, `https://docs.[query].com`, or similar common patterns, or use a simple search engine query (e.g., `"[query] official documentation"` via a backend search tool).
* **F2.3:** Fetch HTML content from the target URL(s). Handle basic HTTP errors.

### 6.3. Content Processing & Markdown Generation
* **F3.1:** Utilize libraries (e.g., Cheerio) to parse HTML.
* **F3.2:** Implement strategies to identify and extract the main content block of a webpage (e.g., targeting `<article>`, `<main>`, `div.content`, or using a library like `@mozilla/readability` if feasible within Convex).
* **F3.3:** Remove common non-essential elements (navigation menus, sidebars, headers, footers, ad banners).
* **F3.4:** Convert the cleaned HTML into markdown using a library (e.g., Turndown).
    * Support for core markdown syntax: headings, paragraphs, bold/italic, lists (ordered/unordered), code blocks (attempt to preserve language hints), links, blockquotes.
    * Basic table conversion if feasible.

### 6.4. Output & Delivery
* **F4.1:** Display the generated markdown text directly within the web interface (e.g., using `react-markdown` or a simple `<pre>` tag for MVP).
* **F4.2:** "Copy to Clipboard" button for the generated markdown.
* **F4.3:** "Download .md File" button to save the markdown locally.

## 7. Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** React (with TypeScript), Tailwind CSS (for styling).
* **Backend:** Convex (Serverless data backend, server functions in TypeScript/JavaScript).
* **Key Backend Libraries:**
    * `node-fetch` or Convex's native fetch for HTTP requests.
    * `cheerio` for server-side HTML parsing and manipulation.
    * `turndown` (or similar) for HTML-to-Markdown conversion.
    * (Potentially) A search API client library if integrated.
* **Deployment:**
    * Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or similar static hosting providers.
    * Backend: Convex platform.

## 8. Success Metrics (for V1.0)

* **SM1: Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of user requests that successfully generate and deliver a markdown document. Target: >80% for well-known documentation sites.
* **SM2: User Satisfaction (Qualitative):** Feedback gathered via a simple in-app feedback form or user interviews focusing on the relevance and quality of the generated markdown.
